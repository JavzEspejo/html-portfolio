<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Javahar Ramesch Espejo, but you can call me Javz for short!</p>

<p>For 5 years I have been a content writer. However, I realized that being a writer isn't my calling. So, I decided to branch out, leave my comfort zone and try something new. 
  This is where I decided to practice web development!</p>

<p>I still have a long way to go and my goal is that by the end of 2024, I'll have at least an intermediate knowledge in web development and be able to use 
  my newly found skills to find a job and start a new career!
