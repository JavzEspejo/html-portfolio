<h1>The Best Movies according to Javz</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>12 Angry Men</h3>
<p>It's quite a simple movie about 12 men doing jury duty. Still, it's a good movie.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Probably the best sci-fi movie I've seen. The twist at the end is so good!</p>
<h3>Spider-Man</h3>
<p>This applies to all Spider-Man movies. I love it ever since I was just a kid</p>
